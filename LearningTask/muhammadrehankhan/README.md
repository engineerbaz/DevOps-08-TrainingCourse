How to deploy nodejs app to AWS EC2 Ubuntu 22 Server with free SSL and Nginx reverse proxy

## Installation instructions

### 1. Launch amazon ubuntu server in aws + Attach Elastic IP to the new instance

### 2. ssh to ubuntu to install packages

```sh
ssh -i <key.pem> ubuntu@<ip-address> -v
```

### 3. Update and Upgrade linux machine and install node and nvm 

```sh
sudo apt update
```

```sh
sudo apt upgrade
```

```sh
sudo apt install -y git htop wget
```

#### 3.1 install node

To **install** or **update** nvm, you should run the [install script][2]. To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```
Or
```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm`, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).

#### 3.2 Copy & Past (each line separately)
<a id="profile_snippet"></a>
```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

#### 3.3 Verify that nvm has been installed

```sh
nvm --version
```

#### 3.4 Install node

```sh
nvm install --lts # Latest stable node js server version
```

#### 3.5 Check nodejs installed
```sh
node --version
```

#### 3.6 Check npm installed
```sh
npm -v
```

### 4. Clone nodejs-ssl-server repository

```sh
cd /home/ubuntu
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rehankhanmrk/nodejs_cicd_github_action.git
```

### 5. Run node app.js  (Make sure everything working)

```sh
cd nodejs-ssl-server
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
node app.js
```

### 6. Install pm2
```sh
npm install -g pm2 # may require sudo
```

### 7. Starting the app with pm2 (Run nodejs in background and when server restart)
```sh
pm2 start app.js --name=nodejs-ssl-server
```
```sh
pm2 save     # saves the running processes
                  # if not saved, pm2 will forget
                  # the running apps on next boot
```

#### 7.1 IMPORTANT: If you want pm2 to start on system boot
```sh
pm2 startup # starts pm2 on computer boot
```

### 8. FREE SSL - Install Nginx web server

```sh
sudo apt install nginx
```

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

#### Add the following to the location part of the server block

```sh
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; #whatever port your app runs on
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
```

##### Check NGINX config
```sh
sudo nginx -t
```

##### Restart NGINX
```sh
sudo service nginx restart
```

#### You should now be able to visit your IP with no port (port 80) and see your app. Now let's add a domain

### 9 Add domain in goDaddy.com & Cloudflare ...
If you have domain, you can add A record to your EC2 instance IP with a new subdomain as I'm going to show you next

#### 9.1 Check that Port 80 redirect to Nodejs server

### 10 Installing Free SSL

#### 10.1 Installing Certbot

```sh
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
```

```sh
sudo apt remove certbot
```

```sh
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

```sh
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

#### 10.2 Confirming Nginx‚Äôs Configuration
```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

let edit this line:
```sh
...
server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
...
```

```sh
sudo nginx -t
```

```sh
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

#### 10.3 Obtaining an FREE SSL Certificate
```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d your.domain.com 
```

Output:
```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2022-06-01.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

```

#### 10.4 Verifying Certbot Auto-Renewal
```sh
sudo systemctl status snap.certbot.renew.service
```
Output:
```
‚óã snap.certbot.renew.service - Service for snap application certbot.renew
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/snap.certbot.renew.service; static)
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ‚óè snap.certbot.renew.timer
```

To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

```sh
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
